Description: In this project, you play as Anti-Polluter Scooter, traversing the 
worlds cities to help fight pollution by getting rid of trash bags as you take a 
scenic trip.

How To: Before running this project, you must open the "HackBeanPotProject" folder 
and download both the "HBPZTypeGame.java" file and "HBPZTypeILoWord.java" file. 
You must open the "SupportingFiles" folder and download the "javalib.jar" file 
and the "tester.jar" file. You must open the "images" folder and download the 9
png files in the folder. The "BaseFiles" folder can be ignored, as it is not 
needed for the project to run. You must download Eclipse version JavaSE-22 from
the Oracle website. Once you open up Eclipse, you should press the "File" button
at the top left of the window and click "New" then click "Project..." and open the
"Java" folder. Select "Java Project" and press "next" and enter any project name.

In the "JRE" box, there will be drop down menu on the same row as "Use an execution 
environment JRE:". Select "JavaSE-22". Click "Finish" near the bottom of the window.
Open up the project file you have created and select "src". Double click "src", click
"Properties" and then click "Java Build Path". There should by five titles, select
"Libraries" and click "Classpath" to then click "Add External JARS" to add in the
two files from the "SupportingFiles folder". 

Click "Apply and Close" near the bottom right of the window. Along the top of the window, 
there were be multiple icons. Look for just a green circle with a white triangle 
in the center. Press the dark triangle pointing downwards to the right of the icon 
and click "Run Configurations". Under the "Main" title, make sure that your project folder 
is in the name of the "Project" text field. In the "Main class:" field, look to the right and 
click "Search" and click "Main - tester" and click "okay". 

Go to your file explorer and move your "HackBeanPotProject" files into the "src" 
folder in your java project folder you 
have named. Right click the java project you had named and click "Refresh" in the
drop down menu. Go back to the drop-down menu to the right of the green circle with
a white triangle and click "Run Configurations". 

Click "Arguments" and under the "Program arguments" text field, enter "ExamplesGame" 
and then click "Apply" and click "Close". Create an empty folder, name it whatever you like, 
and place all of the "images" files into the folder you created. 

Move the folder containing the "images" files and move it to the projects "src" folder 
we previously accessed. Press "ctrl f" on your keyboard and search "fromfileimage". 

For every one of these, you will have to replace the directory that is in the string 
with the images labeled the same as in the string for that line. You are now ready to play our game!
